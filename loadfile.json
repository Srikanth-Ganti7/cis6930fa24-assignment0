Livshits and his co-conspirators allegedly unlawfully sourced, purchased, and shipped military and sensitive dual-use technologies from United States manufacturers to Russian end users. These items included advanced testing equipment used in quantum computing, hypersonic missiles, nuclear weapons development, and other military and space-based military applications.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Serniya’s clients included the National Research Nuclear University of the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute; the Ministry of Defense; the Foreign Intelligence Service (\"SVR\"); and various components of the Federal Security Service (\"FSB\"), Russia's principal security agency and the main successor agency to the Soviet Union's KGB.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Livshits allegedly controlled several American and international front companies that operated on behalf of the Serniya Network. These entities conducted no actual business and were allegedly used to obfuscate the role of Russian or sanctioned entities in transactions with American and Western technology companies. Livshits allegedly facilitated the financing and smuggling of tens of thousands of controlled, American-manufactured military grade sniper bullets and rounds.  Livshits was indicted by the United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, Brooklyn, New York, on December 5, 2022, and a federal warrant was issued for his arrest.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Ida had left her husband in March 1958 and was hospitalized soon after for various illnesses. As a result, her estranged husband placed their children in a boarding home and moved to Chicago while Ida was in the hospital. The state of Michigan took custody of the children and Ida had been fighting to get them back since she was released. Arrangements had been made for Ida and her children to fly to Florida to visit family after the September 19, 1958, court date but she did not show. Prior to her disappearance, Ida remained in constant contact with her family via mail. Anyone with information regarding Ida’s disappearance is asked to contact the Ann Arbor Police Department.</p>",

He was missing 10 teeth to include his two upper front teeth and there was evidence of a healed nasal fracture. The cause of death could not be determined; however, based on how the body was found this case is considered a homicide.
